# MH-Core-Dataset
Converts the MH core dataset into local KPIs, adds SPCs icons and trend summary

The rmd is the R markdown file to use

The other main data you will need is the MH core datapack from NHS futures.

Need to create a project and put all Icon image files and metadata file into same directory.

Am working on making the KPI names cleaner throughout code and also make it more adjustable so that other regions can use code.
